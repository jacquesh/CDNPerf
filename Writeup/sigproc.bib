 	abstract={
 	The CIPRES Science Gateway is a community web application that provides public access to a set of parallel tree inference and multiple sequence alignment codes run on large computational resources. These resources are made available at no charge to users by the NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project. Here we describe the CIPRES RESTful application programmer interface (CRA), a web service that provides programmatic access to all resources and services currently offered by the CIPRES Science Gateway. Software developers can use the CRA to extend their web or desktop applications to include the ability to run MrBayes, BEAST, RAxML, MAFFT, and other computationally intensive algorithms on XSEDE. The CRA also makes it possible for individuals with modest scripting skills to access the same tools from the command line using curl, or through any scripting language. This report describes the CRA and its use in three web applications (Influenza Research Database â€“ www.fludb.org, Virus Pathogen Resource â€“ www.viprbrc.org, and MorphoBank â€“ www.morphobank.org). The CRA is freely accessible to registered users at https://cipresrest.sdsc.edu/cipresrest/v1; supporting documentation and registration tools are available at https://www.phylo.org/restusers.

 	abstract = "Abstract E-science infrastructures are becoming the essential tools for computational scientific research. In this paper, we describe two e-science infrastructures: Science and Engineering Applications Grid (SEAGrid) and molecular modeling and parametrization (ParamChem). The \{SEAGrid\} is a virtual organization with a diverse set of hardware and software resources and provides services to access such resources in a routine and transparent manner. These essential services include allocations of computational resources, client-side application interfaces, computational job and data management tools, and consulting activities. ParamChem is another e-science project dedicated for molecular force-field parametrization based on both ab-initio and molecular mechanics calculations on high performance computers (HPCs) driven by scientific workflow middleware services. Both the projects share a similar three-tier computational infrastructure that consists of a front-end client, a middleware web services layer, and a remote \{HPC\} computational layer. The client is a Java Swing desktop application with components for pre- and post-data processing, communications with middleware server and local data management. The middleware service is based on Axis2 web service and MySQL relational database, which provides functionalities for user authentication and session control, \{HPC\} resource information collections, discovery and matching, job information logging and notification. It can also be integrated with scientific workflow to manage computations on \{HPC\} resources. The grid credentials for accessing \{HPCs\} are delegated through MyProxy infrastructure. Currently \{SEAGrid\} has integrated several popular application software suites such as Gaussian for quantum chemistry, \{NAMD\} for molecular dynamics and engineering software such as Abacus for mechanical engineering. ParamChem has integrated \{CGenFF\} (CHARMM General Force-Field) for molecular force-field parametrization of drug-like molecules. Long-term storage of user data is handled by tertiary data archival mechanisms. \{SEAGrid\} science gateway serves more than 500 users while more than 1000 users use ParamChem services such as atom typing and initial force-field parameter guess at present.
