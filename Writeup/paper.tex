\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In the modern internet, 65\% of web traffic is handled by just 10 organisations \cite{Gehlen2012}. These organisations have to serve tremendous amounts of data to a large user base across the globe. Vast Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and data centres are therefore required to serve up all this content. Approximately 90\% of Google's traffic and over 50\% of Level3 and Limelight's traffic is from video content alone \cite{Gehlen2012}.

Of the video streaming services on the internet, YouTube is most popular with over a billion users \cite{youtubeStats}. Everyday, YouTube generates billions of views with people watching hundreds of million of hours of content \cite{youtubeStats}. 

Our aim in this paper is to investigate the performance of the CDN's that serve this content. We will examine different streaming services from a variety of South African Internet Service Providers (ISP) to examine how traffic is routed and where it comes from. In addition, we will also examine the caching behaviour of YouTube, which has local caches in South Africa.
